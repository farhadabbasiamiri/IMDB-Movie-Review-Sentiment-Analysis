# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis 🎬🧠

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. It includes model training using TensorFlow and a user-friendly **Streamlit** web application for real-time sentiment prediction.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify IMDB movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative** using a simple RNN model. The model is trained on the built-in IMDB dataset from TensorFlow and is saved in `.h5` format for reuse. A **Streamlit app** is also included to allow users to test the model with custom input through a simple web interface.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Train the Model (Optional)

If you'd like to train the model from scratch:

```bash
python simple_rnn.py
```

This will save the trained model as `simple_rnn_imdb.h5`.

### 2. Run the Streamlit App

Launch the app with:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

You’ll be able to enter a movie review in the text box and see the model’s sentiment prediction (positive/negative).

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Input: IMDB movie reviews (preprocessed and tokenized)
- Embedding Layer
- Simple RNN Layer
- Dense output layer with sigmoid activation

---

## 📊 Output

- The Streamlit app provides:
  - A text input box for entering a review
  - A button to run prediction
  - A label showing whether the review is **positive** or **negative**

---

## ✅ To-Do (Optional)

- Improve model accuracy with LSTM/GRU
- Add preprocessing UI in Streamlit
- Model deployment on Hugging Face or Heroku
